## Project Reflection

This project was built during my Masters. It was my addicional learning and projects in web application sector.

The main goal of the project was to create an application designed to monitor monthly expenses and assist in planning a monthly budget

The project helped me consolidate my existing knowledge and gain experience in writing code in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
